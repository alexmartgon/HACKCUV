# HACKCUV
Here are some cool things to learn for pushing stuff for our repository and pulling from it too!
There are two ways to use github without a linux:
1. Github Desktop
2. GitBash

I have already used GitBash once, it is very similar to what I use so it should be a little bit harder to learn but not too bad.
Github Desktop is veeeeery simple.

Here are some commands or lists of commands that are useful when using gitbash:
	 
CLONE REPOSITORY:
	 1. git clone "Link that github gives you when you click clone"

PUSH TO REPOSITORY:
	1. git add .
	2. git commit -m "Message of what you did"
	3. If it is the first time you do this it will ask for who you are. Follow the instructions. And then do step 2 again,
	4. git push (It will ask you for username and password. do that)

PULL FROM REPOSITORY:
	1. git pull
